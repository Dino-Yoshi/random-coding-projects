# gradeBook Program in C# #

## Bad Input must be handled 
## File must be handled well

# The user should have a menu, with options to interact with:
	- Adding Grades to the book
		- This will require a name, a score
		- Which then is saved to a file named "records.txt"
	- Reading the "records.txt" file.
		- Displays all students and their respective grades one by one on newlines
	
# Records Class #
	- Upon initalization:
	- A new record object will require a grade, and a student's name.
	- To add more than one grade to a specific record object, the student name will serve as an identifier
	
	- Initialization Variables:
		- StudentName, able to be retrieved and set
		- AverageGrade, able to be retrieved
	
	- List of Grades, a new class called Grades that then stores the grades of a student.
		- This is important for when we want to retrieve the average, and can accumluate an overall score divided by total points of all assignments combined
	
# Grades Class #
	- Upon Initialization:
	- A new Grade object requires a Grade, Assignment Name
	- Grades can be retrieved, so getters are necessary.
	- Assignment names are not as important, so getter is optional.
